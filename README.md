News Story Testing Scenario - 

-Like Count (Feature not implemented yet)\
-Post comment button (Feature not implemented yet)\
-Swiping left to open the browser\ 
-Swiping up or down to go back to the home page\

In order to run the unit tests, simply run the file in the VS Code. Once the application is running, unit tests can be run by going to the file news_story_test.dart in the test folder. Simply clicking on the small run next to the unit tests allows us to run the test, and the results of the test are reflected next to it. A green tick signifies that the unit test was successful, whereas the red exclamation mark signifies failure.
